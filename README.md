  ## Description 
  In this project I will be asking a user to input what position they are hired and will have 3 different question as one for manager, engineer and intern. if a user select engineer it will take them to engineer question. 
  On app.js line 16 I made an empty array for all the questions answered to be stored.
  I've also learned a new method called switch which is similar to a "IF" statment so switch(teammember <- here is my function then points to createTeamember>). Then inside this function i have case as manager which is on my line 23. Then I also created a new function which is call runManager where I will be making on line 44 this will start my questions.This method goes on for other choices as well except for the last question. 
  on line 134-138 Once the team is done it will make a new output file and if it exist overwrite anyways..
